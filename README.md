# devops_assignment

A demonstration of Docker to implement a simple 3 tier architecture

* frontend will be able to access the mid-tier
* mid-tier will be able to access the db

In order to run this in docker, simply type ```docker-compose up``` at the command prompt. Docker will then create the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) from the stock [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) image.
